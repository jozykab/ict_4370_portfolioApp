    provided in the assignment instructions) to be in the same repository in order to run
    successfully.
    - Requires AllStocks.json file to run.
    - After running successfully, the code will generate a report file named
    {investor_name}_investment_report.txt
    - The Code will generate the data char file named line_chart.svg

## Troubleshooting Tips:
    If ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter' => Make sure you install the python-tk or
    python3-tk package

    # Make sure to specify correct Python version.
    # For example, if you run Python v3.9 run adjust command to
    brew install python-tk@3.9

    If you are on Windows, you have to make sure to check the optiontcl/tk and IDLE when installing Python.
    If you already installed Python, download the installer, run it and click Modify. Then check the tcl/tk and IDLE checkbox to install tkinter for your Python version.
